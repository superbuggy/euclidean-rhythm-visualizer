## A Brief Introduction to Euclidean Rhythms


> What makes a Rhythm Euclidean?

To answer this question in more depth well have to talk about a couple algorithms, but put simply, a Euclidean rhythm will distribute a certain number of pulses over a number of steps.

### Example I: 2 pulses over 8 steps

Let's look at a simple example...

> 2 pulses, in yellow, over 8 steps.

![2 pulses, in yellow, over 8 steps, or X---X---](./images/euclid2-8.jpg)

In yellow we have the pulses, and in brown are the inactive steps, or speaking musically, rests.

> Each step has the same duration. My project uses a default step duration of an 8th note. At 120 beats per minute, an eighth note lasts .25 seconds.

The result is that we have 2 pulses evenly distributed over 8 steps, where each step has the same duration (.25 seconds at 120bpm).

The resulting sound is a regular, mechanical ticking that sounds like a metronome or a timepiece that has an audible click. Not a super interesting rhythm.

### Example II: 3 pulses over 8 steps

Since clock-like isn't particularly interesting on a rhythmic level, we can vary the number of pulses we distribute over the 8 steps.

> "In Cuba it goes by the name of the tresillo and in the USA is often called the Habanera rhythm used in hundreds of rockabilly songs during the 1950’s" (Toussaint, 4).

### Euclidean Rhythms in Musical Traditions Around the World

It turns out that certain distributions of pulses over steps actually generate rhythms that are the basis of a wide variety of musical traditions around the world, in particular rhythms found in musical traditions through Africa. It is not good at generating rhythms
